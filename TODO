dream table (working title)

- it's like a spreadsheet for pixel art
- you start out with an infinite empty grid
- click and drag to create thingies
- wire them together to create game assets

- design goals
  - modular
  - non-destructive
  - minimalist
  - keyboard friendly

- what to work on
  x right click drag to create new canvas thingies
  x selection and deletion
  x left click drag to move canvas thingies
  x draw tool
  x dropper tool
  x grid tool
  - cellref tool
  - modal tools / tool thingy
  > right click drag on canvas thingies to resize
  - scaling (s + wheel)
  - import via drag and drop

- controls
  x on grid
    x left click: deselect
    x left click drag: box select
    x middle click drag: pan
    x right click: create a thingy

  - on a canvas thingy

- thingies
  - canvases
    - a canvas is a 2d array of pixels that you can draw on
    - has a width and height and a scale (default = 1)
    - has an grid of its own (default = width x height, so just one cell)
    - subregions of the grid are called cells
    - cells can be named?
    - other thingies can reference the canvas, or a particular cell
    - cells can be references to other canvases or their cells
      - "cellref painter"
        - source: canvas with a grid
        - dest: canvas with a grid
        - updates grid references to refer to source
          - for building sprite sheets, tilemaps, animations
    - canvas with scale 4 referencing canvas with scale 1
      - aka a magnifier
      - paint on either one

  - brushes
    - use a canvas as a brush

  - patterns
    - literally just canvases

  - palettes

  - layers

  - libraries / sequences?

  - timelines
    - 1d array of (cell ref, duration)
    - output can be referenced elsewhere (e.g. animated tilemap)

  - generators
    - e.g. create wang tiles

  - drivers (clocks? buttons?)
    - play/pause/stop/frame advance buttons for animations

  - importers
    - load from disk (watch files for changes)
    - useful for reference images too

  - exporters
    - write to disk as sheets or individual files

- workflows I want to enable
  - draw a tilemap that refers to a sprite sheet, and updates when you draw on it
  - build your own editor
  - export in a variety of formats

- polish
  - UI themes (gotham, solarized, monochrome dark, monochrome light)
  - z-order for thingies
  - camera velocity (fling/zoom)
  - camera ease to target
  - zoom based on cursor position
  - zoom to fit selected objects
  - change zoom on window resize
  - touch support
  - drag and drop
  - shift+select to expand selection
  - move all selected thingies
  - copy and paste palette strings (or individual colors)
  - copy and paste thingies (and selections of thingies)
  - lock thingies to screen
  - saving / loading layouts
  - merging project files
  - undo / redo / autosave
  - help / welcome / splash
  - multiple viewports, blender-style
  - ecosystem compat (aseprite, tiled, godot)
  - load fantasy console carts (pico-8, tic-80...)
  - a trailer to promote it
  - better names?
    - collagen? collage, generate, glue / binding together (not very googleable)
    - dream desk? (nope, taken by a crappy VR app)

- extremely wild ideas!
  - scripting (lua or python or whatever)
  - make it a fantasy console, lol
    - like a fantasy console exploded onto your desk
  - audio synthesis and code
